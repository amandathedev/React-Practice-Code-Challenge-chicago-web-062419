<!-- Clicking the "More Sushi!" button shows the next set of 4 sushi in the list. -->

Clicking a sushi on a plate will eat the sushi, causing it to be removed from its plate and an empty plate to appear on the table.

Whenever a sushi is eaten, customers should be automatically charged!

Customers cannot eat any sushi that exceeds the amount of money remaining in their balance

Bonus:
SushiWallet! Add a form for customers to add more money to their balance
Full rotation! When the end of the line of sushi is reached, the conveyor belt should start from the beginning. Sushi that have already been eaten should remain eaten. It would be creepy if they reappeared!
